# Eveldee.3DSCPlusViGEm

This is a **Windows** client for [**3DSController+**](https://github.com/SonoSooS/3DSCPlus)  
It perfectly emulates an **Xbox360**/**DS4** controller using [**ViGem**](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus)

## Installation

- Install **3DSController+** on your **3DS** using this [guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/3dscontrollerplus-pc-3ds-video-and-input-streaming.447362/) (skip if already done)
- Install latest [**ViGEmBus**](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)
- Download latest version from [**Releases**](https://github.com/Eveldee/Eveldee.3DSCPlusViGEm/releases)

## Usage

Just run it, enter your **3DS** IP address (you can see it on the 3DS top screen while running PaintController)  
Click on **Connect**, Windows should tell you that it's configuring the **Xbox360**/**DS4** controller, and you're ready to go! 

**Note:**
- Inputs follow position layout: **Xbox360** X/Y and A/B are reversed (can be configured)
- It should even works using multiple **3DS**, just run it for each **3DS** (not tested)

## Roadmap

- [x] Emulate DS4 controller (useful for PS4 Remote Play)
- [x] Key mappings configuration
- [x] Axis settings (inverted, deadzone)
- [x] Touch screen mapping configuration
